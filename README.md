# Getting Things Done - A TODO List in Java


This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2023).

## Overview

### Project Description
This project is a implementation of a TODO List according to the principles of Getting Things done (GTD).
It focuses on Test Driven Development and the principles of Object Oriented Programming.
The final product is a command line application that allows the user to create, edit and delete tasks and projects.
Task rank automatically and can be sorted and grouped with tags.
The automated ranking will also take into account what activities the user has done in the past and what activities the user has planned for the future.
