# HWR OOP Project - To-Do-List

This project is part of OOP with Paul, Benjamin, Jonas and Christian 2023

Feaures follow the "getting things done" method

Yellow - Objects, classes, other java options
Red - Applications of project
Green - net to know - function of "gtd"

Starts with In-Tray -- "lose Gedanken welche keine wirklichen Tasks beinhaltet"

[TODO]: # (Change README.md Headline to better fit to your project!) Done!
        # (Create Objects of project containing all features provided by prof)
        
> :warning: first Class Diagram added

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2023).

## Abstract

[TODO]: # (Write a short description of your project.)
[TODO]: # (State most important features.)
[TODO]: # (State the most interesting problems you encountered during the project.)

## Feature List

[TODO]: # (For each feature implemented, add a row to the table!)

| Number | Feature | Tests |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 1      | Task       | /     |
| 2      | Project | /     |
| 3      | Tags    | /     |


## Additional Dependencies

[TODO]: # (For each additional dependency your project requires- Add an additional row to the table!)

| Number | Dependency Name | Dependency Description | Why is it necessary? |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 1      | /               | /                      | /                    |

## Instructions

[TODO]: # (Remove these instructions once you finished your fork's setup.)

Use a fork of this repository to do implement your project.

Remember to add this repository as a second remote repository (upstream) and pull from the correct remotes.
This is necessary, because we might apply changes to this template during the next month.

The following section describes how to add multiple remote repositories to your local repository, which is cloned from the fork.

### Multiple remote repositories

Your local repository should have a reference to both the fork (your own remote repository) and the original remote repository.
To configure your git remote repositories, use the `git remote` command set.

1. Clone your fork and go enter the repository.
```
git clone <fork-url>
cd <created-folder>
```
2. Now your fork is configured as primary remote repository (origin).
Next to origin, you should add the original repository as a second remote repository (upstream).
```
git remote add upstream <repository-url>
```
3. Verify that both remotes are configured correctly.
The following command should list both remotes: origin and upstream.
```
git remote -v
```
4. To fetch changes from all remote repositories, use:
```
git fetch --all
```
5. If there are interesting changes (in e.g. the `main` branch) to merge into your branch, use:
```
git pull upstream main
```
