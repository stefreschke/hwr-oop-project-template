# CHESS - HWR OOP Lecture Project
This repository contains our (Alex, Maja, Felix, Gero, Laura) student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented
programming with Java/Kotlin at HWR Berlin (summer term 2024).

> :warning: This code is for educational purposes only. Do not rely on it!

## Prerequisites

1. IDE of your choice installed (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA)
2. JDK of choice installed (e.g. through IntelliJ IDEA)
3. Maven installed (e.g. through IntelliJ IDEA)
4. Git installed

## Local Development

This project uses [Apache Maven][maven] as build tool.

To build from your shell (without an additional local installation of Maven), ensure that `./mvnw`
is executable:

```
chmod +x ./mvnw
```

We recommend not to dive into details about Maven at the beginning.
Instead, you can use [just][just] to build the project.
It reads the repositories `justfile` which maps simplified commands to corresponding sensible Maven
calls.

With _just_ installed, you can simply run this command to perform a build of this project and run
all of its tests:

```
just build
```

## Abstract

Objective of this project is to implement the game Chess while learning object-oriented programming with Java/Kotlin.

Chess is a game of skill for two players, each of whom moves 16 figures according to fixed rules across a board consisting 
of an eight-by-eight pattern of squares. Victory depends on concentration and intuitive vision. It is often called the royal game.

The chessboard is a miniature battlefield, and the opposing armies are called white and black. Each consists of eight 
so-called pieces—a king, a queen, two bishops, two knights, and two rooks —and eight pawns. \[...\] The object is to make a successful 
attack upon the enemy king. The king is not actually captured; it is enough to produce a position in which the king cannot escape. 
This situation is called a checkmate and ends the game. [^1]
