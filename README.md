## Instructions

[TODO]: # (Remove these instructions once you finished your fork's setup.)

Use a fork of this repository to do implement your project.

Remember to add this repository as a second remote repository (upstream) and pull from the correct remotes.
This is necessary, because we might apply changes to this template during the next month.

The following section describes how to add multiple remote repositories to your local repository, which is cloned from the fork.

### Multiple remote repositories

Your local repository should have a reference to both the fork (your own remote repository) and the original remote repository.
To configure your git remote repositories, use the `git remote` command set.

1. Clone your fork and go enter the repository.
```
git clone <fork-url>
cd <created-folder>
```
2. Now your fork is configured as primary remote repository (origin).
Next to origin, you should add the original repository as a second remote repository (upstream).
```
git remote add upstream <repository-url>
```
3. Verify that both remotes are configured correctly.
The following command should list both remotes: origin and upstream.
```
git remote -v
```
4. To fetch changes from all remote repositories, use:
```
git fetch --all
```
5. If there are interesting changes (in e.g. the `main` branch) to merge into your branch, use:
```
git pull upstream main
```
